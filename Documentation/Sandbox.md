# How sandbox will process the transactions
Since we are in a testing environment, we cannot process the transactions in the same way that production does. For that reason, we have created a simple way for you to follow the whole lifecycle of the transaction.

each transaction will change their status until they reach one of the following status: failed, cancelled, or successful; depending on the transaction amount. These rules apply to all funding, withdraw, .

Amounts

The transaction status will change based on its amount. If you want your transactions to fall in the next statuses, please create them under the following rules:
